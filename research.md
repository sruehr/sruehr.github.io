# Ecosystem reliance on groundwater
Groundwater is a critical freshwater resource for both people and ecosystems. Plants in arid and semi-arid systems often rely on groundwater throughout the year and during droughts. Access to water enables plants to continue fixing carbon from the atmosphere even under dry conditions. I use remote sensing and eddy covariance data to untangle the effects of groundwater depletion on ecosystems that are dependent on this resource.



# Solar-induced fluorescence
Solar-induced fluorescence (SIF) is a phenomenon of plants 'glowing' as they perform photosynthesis. Photosynthesis can change instantaneously depending on environmental conditions, SIF responds more quickly to water stress than other vegetation indicies (like NDVI). Using SIF from satellite and ground-based sensors allows us to understand ecosystem responses to water stress over time and space.



# Field work
I'm out in the field! 

## SIF imager
Along with a team of other scientists and students, I am deploying a solar-induced fluorescence imager at several sites throughout California. This imager can take pictures of photosynthesis happening in real time across a landscape, capturing differences in carbon fixation rates between individual plants and even leaves.

## Tonzi Ranch 
Tonzi Ranch is an AmeriFlux eddy covariance site operated by the Baldocchi group at UC Berkeley. The site has been shown to depend on groundwater throughout the dry season, which makes it a great site to explore my research questions.
