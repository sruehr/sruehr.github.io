I am a PhD candidate in UC Berkeley’s Department of Environmental Science, Policy and Management, where I am advised by Trevor Keenan and Manuela Girotto. My work focuses on the biophysical effects of drought at ecosystem and landscape scales. Using near-surface and satellite remote sensing data, I’ve studied how [groundwater drought](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.agrformet.2023.109725) affects carbon sequestration, the effectiveness of [cutting-edge hyperspectral instruments](https://doi.org/10.1029/2023GL107429) to estimate primary productivity, and the benefits of sustainable management strategies on agricultural water-use efficiency. In 2025, I will begin a postdoctoral fellowship within the Rosa and Dukes labs at the Carnegie Institution for Science at Stanford. Having worked as a journalist and oral historian, I'm also interested in human perceptions of environmental change, especially when these differ from scientific findings. 

Before starting at UC Berkeley, I lived in Cape Cod, Massachusetts and Vanuatu, a Pacific island nation where I collected oral histories about climate change. I've worked as a newspaper staff reporter and have written about seal population booms, water pollution, tenant farmers and illicit mushroom foragers. My work has appeared in the [_Provincetown Independent_](https://provincetownindependent.org/author/s-ruehr/), [_InsideClimate News_](https://insideclimatenews.org/news/01102019/hurricane-warm-water-climate-change-history-science-study-sediment-core-donnelly-muller/) and the [_Provincetown Banner_](https://www.wickedlocal.com/story/provincetown-banner/2018/09/06/number-one-issue-at-ponds/10834043007/).

I graduated from Yale University with a B.S. in Geology & Geophysics. I write songs for jazz guitar and regulary perform in the East Bay with [my band](https://www.instagram.com/soph.n.gabe/).
