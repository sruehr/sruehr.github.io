I'm a Ph.D. candidate at UC Berkeley Department of Environmental Science, Policy and Management, where I work with Trevor Keenan and Manuela Girotto. I'm interested in water and carbon cycling at regional to global scales using remote sensing and eddy covariance data. Having worked as a journalist and oral historian, I'm also interested in human perceptions of environmental change, especially when they differ from scientific findings. 

Before starting at UC Berkeley, I lived in Cape Cod, Massachusetts and Vanuatu, a Pacific island nation where I collected oral histories about climate change. I've worked as a reporter and have written about seal population booms, gypsy moth invasions, water pollution, tenant farmers and illicit mushroom foragers. My work has appeared in the _ _Provincetown Banner_, _ _Provincetown Independent_ and _ _InsideClimate News_.

I graduated from Yale University in 2018 with a B.S. in Geology & Geophysics. I also write song for jazz guitar and regulary perform in Oakland with [my band](https://www.instagram.com/soph.n.gabe/).
