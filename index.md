I am a Ph.D. candidate at University of California Berkeley Department of Environmental Science, Policy and Management, where I work with [Trevor Keenan](https://www.keenangroup.info/){:target="_blank" rel="noopener"} and [Manuela Girotto](https://nature.berkeley.edu/girottolab/){:target="_blank" rel="noopener"}. I'm interested in water and carbon cycling at regional to global scales using remote sensing and eddy covariance data. My research is supported by a [NASA FINESST](https://nspires.nasaprs.com/external/solicitations/summary!init.do?solId=%7b87947100-56AE-C4DC-C511-0349862D658A%7d&path=open){:target="_blank" rel="noopener"} fellowship. Having worked as a journalist and oral historian, I'm also interested in human perceptions of environmental change, especially when these differ from scientific findings. 

Before starting at UC Berkeley, I lived in Cape Cod, Massachusetts and Vanuatu, a Pacific island nation where I collected oral histories about climate change. I've worked as a newspaper staff reporter and have written about seal population booms, water pollution, tenant farmers and illicit mushroom foragers. My work has appeared in the [_Provincetown Banner_](https://www.wickedlocal.com/story/provincetown-banner/2018/09/06/number-one-issue-at-ponds/10834043007/){:target="_blank" rel="noopener"}, [_Provincetown Independent_](https://provincetownindependent.org/author/s-ruehr/){:target="_blank" rel="noopener"} and [_InsideClimate News_](https://insideclimatenews.org/news/01102019/hurricane-warm-water-climate-change-history-science-study-sediment-core-donnelly-muller/){:target="_blank" rel="noopener"}.

I graduated from Yale University with a B.S. in Geology & Geophysics. I write songs for jazz guitar and regulary perform in Oakland with [my band](https://www.instagram.com/soph.n.gabe/){:target="_blank" rel="noopener"}.
